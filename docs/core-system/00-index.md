# Galfus Core System

This directory documents the base language system of Galfus Script.

The goal of these documents is twofold:

1. Teach how Galfus Script source code is written and how it behaves.
2. Define implementation contracts that the compiler, checker, lowering pipeline, and runtime must preserve.

Galfus is designed around deterministic compilation, explicit surfaces, compact syntax, static typing, explicit ownership behavior, and small runtime targets.

## Contract Language

These documents use the following contract words:

- **MUST**: required behavior.
- **MUST NOT**: forbidden behavior.
- **SHOULD**: recommended behavior unless there is a strong implementation reason to differ.
- **MAY**: allowed behavior.

## Core Invariants

Galfus Script MUST preserve these invariants:

- Source resolution is deterministic.
- Imports are explicit.
- Function return types are explicit.
- Operators have fixed meanings and are not overloaded.
- Complex assignment does not deep-copy.
- Deep copy is explicit through `copy`.
- `instanceof` is the single narrowing expression.
- `for` and function parameters create constant bindings by default.
- Keyword metadata is not the same thing as decorators.
- Decorators are typed transformer functions.
- `ImageModule` serialization is internal to final target bundles only.
