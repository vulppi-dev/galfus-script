# 15. Lowering and Runtime Semantics

This document defines how validated Galfus source semantics lower into runtime representation and final target bundles.

## 15.1 Core Principle

Lowering MUST preserve source semantics exactly.

No lowering step may introduce:

```txt
hidden dynamic typing
implicit deep copy
implicit operator overloading
implicit global imports
implicit function return inference
runtime-dependent compilation behavior
```

## 15.2 Compilation Pipeline

Recommended high-level pipeline:

```txt
1. lexing
2. parsing
3. local symbol collection
4. module/import resolution
5. type resolution
6. generic resolution
7. constraint validation
8. decorator validation and application
9. keyword metadata validation
10. expression/type checking
11. ownership validation
12. lowering to internal ImageModule
13. final target bundle generation
```

Implementation may split or merge phases, but output must be deterministic.

## 15.3 Artifact Model

Public/source-level file types:

```txt
.gfs -> Galfus source
.gfp -> Galfus proxy/adaptor definition
```

Removed public artifacts:

```txt
.gfb
.gfm
```

`ImageModule` is an internal compiler/runtime representation.

It is serialized only inside a final target bundle blob.

Conceptual pipeline:

```txt
.gfs + .gfp
  -> semantic graph
  -> internal ImageModule
  -> target-specific final bundle blob
```

Debug/source information, if needed, belongs to the final target bundle policy, not standalone `.gfm` files.

## 15.4 Module Lowering

Each `.gfs` source module lowers with:

```txt
resolved imports
private declarations
exported declarations
local symbol table
type information
function bodies
ownership metadata
decorator-transformed declarations
keyword metadata
```

Only exported symbols become part of the module surface.

Unused private symbols MAY be removed if observable behavior is unchanged.

## 15.5 Decorator Lowering

Decorators are transformer functions.

They apply closest-to-farthest.

```galfus
@outer
@inner
fn call(): null {
}
```

Conceptual:

```txt
call1 = inner(call)
call2 = outer(call1)
```

Decorators may repeat freely.

Stamped functions cannot receive decorators.

## 15.6 Keyword Metadata Lowering

Compiler-known keyword metadata:

```txt
fn(stamp) -> callsite expansion/lowering-time specialization candidate
loop(after) -> condition-after loop shape
loop(name: X) -> named loop target
for(name: X) -> named for target
new(T, shared) -> shared-capable ownership/runtime marker
enum(T) -> enum discriminant representation
```

Invalid metadata positions are rejected before lowering.

## 15.7 Function Lowering

Every function has explicit return type.

Function parameters lower as constant local bindings.

For return types accepting `null`, fallthrough lowers to `return null`.

Non-null functions require definite return validation before lowering.

Stamped functions must be lowerable inline and cannot be recursive or decorated.

## 15.8 Call Lowering

Call evaluation order:

```txt
target first
arguments left to right
invoke target
```

Trailing defaults may be omitted.

Middle defaults use `_`.

Argument gaps are invalid.

## 15.9 Anchor Call Lowering

```galfus
user::rename("Ana")
```

Conceptual lowering:

```txt
User::rename(user, "Ana")
```

No implicit write-back occurs.

## 15.10 Primitive and Complex Values

Primitive scalar values copy by value.

Complex values are reachable value graphs.

Complex assignment shares the graph.

```galfus
var other = user
```

Deep copy requires:

```galfus
var other = copy user
```

## 15.11 Ownership Lowering

Ownership lowering tracks:

```txt
anchors
edges
weak observers
release points
copy eligibility
resource policies
```

Fields, array elements, tuple elements, and choice payloads may create edges.

Weak fields create weak observers.

## 15.12 Assignment Lowering

Assignment is statement-only.

Compound assignment lowers to operation plus assignment.

```galfus
count += 1
```

Conceptual:

```txt
tmp = count + 1
count = tmp
```

Fallback assignment lowers to a null check.

```galfus
cache ??= createCache()
```

## 15.13 Copy Lowering

`copy` must:

```txt
duplicate owning topology
preserve shared topology inside the copy
validate weak observers
respect resource policies
reject non-copyable values
```

Weak observers are not promoted into owning edges.

Fieldless structs are rejected for `copy`.

## 15.14 Release Points

Graphs are released at deterministic safe points.

Recommended safe points:

```txt
end of statement
after reassignment
end of block
function return
safe loop iteration boundary
```

Weak observers become `null` when their target is released.

## 15.15 Arrays and Strings

Arrays lower to array values.

Fixed-size construction:

```galfus
new([int32; 4])
```

Arrays expose only:

```galfus
values.length
```

Out-of-bounds read returns `null`.

Out-of-bounds write is a runtime error.

String literals lower to UTF-8 `[uint8]` arrays.

## 15.16 Enums and Choices

Enums lower to nominal discriminant values.

Default enum base type is `int32`.

Explicit base type uses `enum(T)`.

Choices lower to tagged unions with optional payloads.

Payloads participate in the ownership graph.

## 15.17 Pattern and Narrowing Lowering

`match` lowers to deterministic pattern selection.

`instanceof` is the single narrowing expression.

It handles:

```txt
primitive narrowing
null narrowing
union narrowing
known generic type-set narrowing
nominal struct narrowing
facade/concrete narrowing
```

`_` must be final when present.

Fallback bindings consume the remaining possible type set and bind that remaining type.

Wildcard fallback consumes the remaining possible type set without creating a binding.

The `instanceof` subject must be a real input expression. `_` is invalid as the subject.

Unreachable non-wildcard patterns are warnings.

## 15.18 Loop and For Lowering

`loop` forms:

```txt
loop { body }
loop condition { body }
loop(after) condition { body }
```

Named loops and named `for` lower to control-flow targets.

`for` source is evaluated once.

Item and index bindings are const.

## 15.19 Range Lowering

Ranges are compiler-known literal iterables.

```txt
start..end
start::count
start::count%step
```

`start..end` lowers conceptually through `std/range::range(start, end)` and has type `RangeExclusive`.

`start::count` and `start::count%step` lower conceptually through `std/range::rangeSteps(start, count, step)` and have type `RangeStepped<int64>` or `RangeStepped<float64>`. `count` is always an integer literal. If `start` or `step` is a float literal, integer literals are promoted and the stepped range uses `float64`.

Invalid:

```galfus
a..b
1..1
1::0
1::-1
1::2%0
1.0..2.0
1::4%0.5
```

Ranges do not materialize arrays.

## 15.20 Constraint Facade Lowering

Constraint facade values expose only constraint-required fields and functions.

Dispatch may use:

```txt
static direct call
compact dispatch metadata
vtable-like representation
```

Observable behavior must remain deterministic.

## 15.21 Generic Lowering

Generic lowering may use monomorphization, shared templates, or a hybrid strategy.

Observable semantics must remain static.

No dynamic `any` or `unknown` behavior is allowed.

## 15.22 Operator Lowering

Operators have fixed meanings.

No operator overloading exists.

Custom behavior lowers through named calls.

## 15.23 Warnings and Errors

Warnings:

```txt
unreachable code
unreachable non-wildcard pattern
unused private declaration
unused local binding
unused import
```

Errors:

```txt
unknown symbol
unknown import
type mismatch
non-exhaustive match
invalid instanceof arm
invalid wildcard position
invalid decorator target/type
invalid metadata target
invalid assignment target
copy of fieldless struct
copy of non-copyable resource
weak field without nullable type
function missing return type
non-null function fallthrough
argument gap
```

## 15.24 Reproducibility

Same source and same dependencies MUST produce the same bundle behavior.

The compiler SHOULD keep deterministic ordering for:

```txt
symbol tables
module traversal
diagnostics
exports
generated ids
bundle sections
```

## 15.25 Contract

Lowering MUST:

- Preserve validated source semantics.
- Emit no standalone `.gfb` or `.gfm` public artifacts.
- Serialize internal `ImageModule` only inside final target bundle blobs.
- Apply decorators closest-to-farthest.
- Reject decorators on stamped functions.
- Keep keyword metadata separate from decorators.
- Treat function parameters and `for` bindings as const.
- Share complex assignment graphs.
- Lower `copy` as explicit deep copy with weak validation.
- Reject `copy` of fieldless structs.
- Use `instanceof` as the only narrowing expression.
- Keep ranges as integer literal iterables.
- Preserve reproducible builds.
