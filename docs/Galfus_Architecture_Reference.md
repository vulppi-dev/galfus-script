# Galfus Architecture Reference

## 1. Core Identity

Galfus Script is a typed, VM-first scripting language with a straightforward pipeline. The primary pipeline is:

```text
.gfs Source
    ↓
Frontend (SemanticGraph)
    ↓
Compiler (BytecodeModule values)
    ↓
Workspace (BytecodeGraph)
    ↓
Runtime (Execution State)
    ↓
VM (Instruction Execution)
```

**What is implemented:**
- Full compiler pipeline (parsing to bytecode)
- In-memory `BytecodeGraph` execution
- Deterministic VM and memory graph
- Optional Host Providers boundary

**What is NOT part of the current architecture:**
- **GFB (Galfus Bytecode File):** Removed. The graph exists only in memory.
- **Bundler:** Not implemented.
- **Optimizer:** Not implemented.
- **Multithreading:** Not implemented.
- **Debugger:** Not implemented.
- **JIT Compilation:** Not implemented.

## 2. The Semantic Graph

The `SemanticGraph` represents the source-level meaning of the workspace.
It contains modules, symbols, typed references, and diagnostics.
The frontend processes source text and updates this graph.

---

## 3. The Bytecode Module

`BytecodeModule` is the isolated executable unit.
Each module contains its private and exported functions, globals, constants, layouts, and bytecode.
There is no global shared namespace. A variable without `export` belongs strictly to its module.

---

## 4. The Bytecode Graph

`BytecodeGraph` represents the complete executable program.
It contains multiple `BytecodeModule`s and their dependencies.
It is the only executable graph. The runtime does not rebuild or duplicate this graph.

The compiler produces a `BytecodeGraphTransaction` for changed modules. The
workspace applies it only to the declared graph version, validates the complete
result, and then publishes the next snapshot. Failed or stale transactions
leave the prior snapshot unchanged.

---

## 5. The Workspace

The `Workspace` owns the current architectural snapshots:
- Source state
- `SemanticGraph` snapshot
- `BytecodeGraph` snapshot

It manages the orchestration of the frontend, compiler, and provides an API for embedding.

---

## 6. Runtime and VM

The runtime executes a borrowed `BytecodeGraph` with optional `Providers`.
Execution state lives in the VM and is partitioned by `ModuleId`, including
globals and initialization status. Dependencies initialize before the entry
module, and the runtime does not duplicate bytecode.

The `VM` executes bytecode instructions. It receives frames containing `ModuleId`, `FunctionId`, and `InstructionOffset`. Execution is implemented fundamentally via a `step` function that runs one instruction at a time.

---

## 7. Providers

Providers represent the boundary between Galfus and the host platform.
The implemented provider surface is synchronous I/O. Additional capabilities
such as file system and network access are planned.
If a provider is not supplied, related builtin calls will fail deterministically, allowing trivial sandboxing.

---

## 8. Execution Metadata

Each `BytecodeNode` may contain optional `ExecutionMetadata` with instruction
spans. Panic frames always contain module ID, function index, and the offset of
the instruction that failed; the runtime formats them and uses spans when they
are available.
Function-symbol and source-path mappings are planned metadata extensions.
